# Requirements

1. install latest node with n
1. install latest coffeescript, currently 1.8.0
1. alias coffee with node --harmony in ~/.bash_profile
        alias coffee='node --harmony /usr/local/bin/coffee'

# Example

Because app.use expects generator function only.  We have to fake one with yield even though that doesn't make much sense.

``` coffeescript

koa = require 'koa'
app = koa()

app.use (next) ->
  start = new Date
  yield next
  ms = new Date - start
  console.log '%s %s - %s', this.method, this.url, ms

# ## Use an unreachable yield
# Because app.use expects generator function only.
# We have to fake one with yield even though that doesn't make much sense.
app.use (n) ->
  this.body = 'Hello World' # return content to client
  yield n # won't reach here


app.listen 3000, console.log "on port 3000"

```

# yield in coffeescript

``` coffeescript

gen = do -> yield i for i in [1..3]
# => {}
gen.next()
# => { value: 1, done: false }
gen.next()
# => { value: 2, done: false }
# => gen.next()
{ value: 3, done: false }
# => gen.next()
{ value: [ undefined, undefined, undefined ], done: true }
# => gen.next()
{ value: undefined, done: true }
gen.next()
# => { value: undefined, done: true }

```
